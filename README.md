## Background

My goal at the end of this bootcamp is to get a position as a junior software developer. This project will help me set up the foundation for my portfolio. As the course progresses and my knowledge is expanding, I would like to build upon this portfolio and add my actual projects to be displayed there.

## Challenges

For me personally, the CSS flexbox code was the most difficult. Getting the different fields to arrange in a way where they look good in both desktop and mobile versions was pretty challenging.

## Learnings

Through this project, I got a lot more comfortable with CSS styling. I learned a lot about hover actions, positioning, color styling and much more.

## Usage

This is a single page website. There is a navigation menu on the top with four links. When either of the first three are pressed, each link will direct you to the corresponding area on the page related to that topic. The last link titles Resume will direct a user to a Google Drive document with my resume.

## Credits

Thank you to Columbia's Full-Stack Web Developer bootcamp for all the assistance and for teaching me all that I have learned.
